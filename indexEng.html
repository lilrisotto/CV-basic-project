            <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Coding - I started with coding in July 2020. Currently I have
                basic knowledge in HTML/CSS/Javascipt, for now I'm focused in
                front-end development. I hope to start with React JS sometime
                this year (or something relatable, I'm very flexible and am
                willing to direct myself into direction of your choice,
                preferably front-end development). I gained most of my knowledge
                on Udemy, where I finished quite a few courses and examples.
                StackOverflow and MDN Web Docs are a huge helpers as well.
              </li>
              <li>
                IT - updated on new technologies in the departemnt of computer
                science/IT and stuff related (hardware/software), mobile
                technology. Currently looking for a good course on
                network&connections.
              </li>
              <li>
                I'm very interested in math, physics and statistics since I was
                young, as a result I am very good with numbers. Sadly current
                job didn't let me maximize in this department (exepct basic
                calculus math/statistics)
              </li>
              <li>
                5 years of experience in music (DJ) and organizing club events
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Education:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Between years 2010 and 2014 I attended Gimnazija Poljane in
                Ljubljana, where I finished Splošna Matura.
              </li>
              <li>
                I continued with Economics studies at Ekonomska Fakulteta UL. I
                stayed there for two years, but sadly I had to find a full time
                job to support myself and didn't manage to finish. In the future
                I would like to get masters at Fakulteta za Računalništvo in
                Informatiko (if/when my finnancial/time situation would allow
                that)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Knowledge</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Fluent in: slovenian, serbo-croatian, english</li>
              <li>
                Above average computer literacy: Microsoft Office (Word, Excel,
                Powerpoint), this year I plan to upgrade my knowledge in Excel
                (complex functions and graphicons), VM (Virtual Machine with
                basic knowledge in: Linux Kali and Oracle), basics in Adobe
                Photoshop, Windows user since Windows 95 (if there is a problem
                with OS i can usually solve it)
              </li>
              <li>
                Excelent comunication and fast learning/adapting to any
                situation: most of my work experience goes in hand with
                comunication and adapting to daily situations.
